### 🎮 Interactive Gameplay
- **Drag & Drop**: Pick up and move cats around the room
- **Care Actions**: Feed, play with, and clean your cats through a popup interface
- **Behavioral Animations**: Watch cats run around randomly, sleep when tired, and express emotions through kaomojis
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Stats decrease over time, requiring active care and attention

### 🏠 Room Customization
- **Furniture Recoloring**: Click on the bed and cat post to cycle through different color variants
- **Isometric Room Design**: A cute perspective view with restricted placement areas for cats

## 🎮 Gameplay Tips

### 🌟 Keeping Cats Happy
- **Feed regularly**: Hunger drops constantly, especially for energetic cats
- **Play when energetic**: High-energy cats need more interaction
- **Clean messy cats**: Some personalities get dirty faster than others
- **Monitor sleep**: Tired cats will sleep automatically, affecting their mood

### 🎨 Room Customization
- **Experiment with colors**: Click furniture multiple times to see all variants
- **Placement strategy**: Position cats where you can easily click them
- **Use debug mode**: Enable yellow outlines to see exact clickable areas
